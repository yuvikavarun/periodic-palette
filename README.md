# Periodic Palette - [View Live Demo](https://yuvikavarun.github.io/periodic-palette/)

An interactive periodic table of elements built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides a responsive, filterable, and visually engaging way to explore the elements of the universe.

## Features

* **Full 118-Element Table:** Displays all elements in their standard periodic table layout, including separate blocks for Lanthanides and Actinides.
* **Interactive Modal:** Click any element to open a modal with detailed information:
    * Atomic Number
    * Atomic Mass
    * Category
    * State at Room Temp
    * Discovery Year
    * A fun fact!
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Instantly filter the table by **element category** (e.g., Noble Gas, Halogen) or **state at room temperature** (Solid, Liquid, Gas).
* **Color-Coded Legend:** A dynamically generated color index at the top clearly shows which color corresponds to which element category.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to all screen sizes, from large desktops to mobile phones.
* **Unique Theme:** A "cosmic pastel neon" dark mode theme with pixel fonts for a fun, retro-tech feel.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout (CSS Grid & Flexbox), custom properties (variables), and media queries for responsiveness.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity, including:
    * Dynamically generating the element cards.
    * Handling click events to show/hide the modal.
    * Populating the modal with the correct element data.
    * Implementing the category and state filtering logic.
    * Generating the color index legend.
